# Phytoremediation-of-indoor-air-pollutants
This project explores the **average indoor levels of key air pollutants** — including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), and particulate matter (PM). These pollutants are commonly found in indoor environments such as residential homes, offices, schools, and public buildings, often exceeding safe thresholds and posing health risks. 

Using a combination of **scientific literature** and **Kaggle datasets**, the project:
- identifies the **sources and impacts** of these pollutants on human health and the environment;
- uses **clear, impactful visualizations** to **communicate risks and patterns**;
- proposes a **nature-based, low-cost solution**: using **air-purifying plants** to absorb or capture these harmful compounds.

The interactive application also features:
- a curated **list of proven effective plant species**, with their scientific names, common names, and images;
- a user-friendly guide for choosing suitable plants to improve indoor air quality.

This project aims to **raise awareness** and offer an **accessible, sustainable strategy** for healthier indoor environments.
